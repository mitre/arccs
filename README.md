<p>
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become increasingly prevalent in the public imagination, and as a result, a variety of commercial enterprises have begun marketing products as “AI-enabled.” However, we see that “AI” has become a marketing buzzword, and not every product claiming to be AI-enabled actually uses AI in a meaningful way. Since AI is such a broad area of study and because vendors often hesitate to share details on underlying algorithms, it is often difficult to determine the effectiveness of these implementations.
  <p>
This document proposes the AI Relevance Competence Cost Score (ARCCS) framework, an evaluation methodology and metrics to assess the degree and effectiveness of the AI component of a commercially offered, AI-enabled tool. The framework guides the assessor to organize the available evidence, evaluate its strength, and determine whether a product performs as advertised in a technically relevant manner. Additionally, ARCCS serves as a guide for further investigation once such a determination is made.
    <p>
ARCCS provides a method for any organization considering the acquisition of AI-enabled tools to make more informed, rigorous, and consistent assessments and final decisions.
