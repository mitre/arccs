### Abstract
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become increasingly prevalent in the public imagination, and as a result, a variety of commercial enterprises have begun marketing products as “AI-enabled.” However, we see that “AI” has become a marketing buzzword, and not every product claiming to be AI-enabled actually uses AI in a meaningful way. Since AI is such a broad area of study and because vendors often hesitate to share details on underlying algorithms, it is often difficult to determine the effectiveness of these implementations.

This document proposes the AI Relevance Competence Cost Score (ARCCS) framework, an evaluation methodology and metrics to assess the degree and effectiveness of the AI component of a commercially offered, AI-enabled tool. The framework guides the assessor to organize the available evidence, evaluate its strength, and determine whether a product performs as advertised in a technically relevant manner. Additionally, ARCCS serves as a guide for further investigation once such a determination is made.

ARCCS provides a method for any organization considering the acquisition of AI-enabled tools to make more informed, rigorous, and consistent assessments and final decisions.
